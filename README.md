================

Drag and drop dynamic bootstrap forms with angular.

## Description

An extendable _angular_ module that allows you and/or your users to design and render _bootstrap_ forms.   
Field components can be dragged from a _pallette_ onto a _canvas_ where details like _validation_, _dragons_ and _ponies_ can be fine-tuned further.
Developers can extend the editor by adding _magic_ like _custom field components_ and _validation patterns_.
